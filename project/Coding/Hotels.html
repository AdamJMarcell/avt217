		  <p>If you're visiting Lancaster, you could book a standard hotel, or you could stay somewhere that actually feels like Lancaster. Hershey Farm Resort isn’t just a place to sleep, but it’s a part of the experience.

At Hershey Farm, you wake up to peaceful countryside views, stroll through 23 acres of beautiful farmland, and relax in a setting that blends comfort with authentic Lancaster County charm. The resort is $121 nightly, but instead of traffic and concrete. The Resort allows you to walk trails, see friendly farm animals, gardens, ponds, and a space to breathe. Hershey Farm is a place where mornings start with fresh, homemade breakfast favorites and evenings end in quiet country air.

Also, you’re exactly where you want to be just minutes from Sight and Sound Theatre, outlet shopping, Amish attractions, and major Lancaster destinations. You get the calm of the country without being far from anything.</p>
