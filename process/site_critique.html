	 <h1>LandcasterPA</h1>
	<h3>LandcasterPA.com</h3>
	<img src="img/Lancaster PA.png" alt="The screen shot of the website">
	
	<h4>Navigation</h4>
	<p>Navigation is easy to use and has all the tabs right underneath the website picture.I would say their are a lot of subheadings. Which would make it harder for the user to really find what to look for. Overall, it gives a lot of information about the city. </p>
		
	<h4>Usability</h4>
	<p>Usability is good becuase by knowing what you are trying to find about Lancaster. All you need to do is find the subheading that it would be under. Each subheading is good at giving more details in the sidebar of where other places in landcaster you could look into.</p>
	
	<h4>Typography and hierarchy</h4>
	<p>The headings could be in bigger font because it can be hard to tell the slight difference between the subheadings. The body text is very readable and easy to read. Thefont style goes well with the theme of the website.</p>
	
	<h4>Overall style/look and feel</h4>
	<p>The look and feel of the website is good because the colors go well together,and has bright background. Which makes the webpage readable and easy too look at. People might be overwhelmed with a lot of links and subheadings. Each subheading page gives valuable infomoration about the city of Lancaster.</p>
